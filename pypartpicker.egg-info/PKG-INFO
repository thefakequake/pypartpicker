        # Basic programs
        Here is a program that searches for i7's, prints every result, then gets the first result and prints its specs.
        ```python
        from pypartpicker import part_search, fetch_product
        
        # returns a list of Part objects we can iterate through
        parts = part_search("i7")
        
        # iterates through every part object
        for part in parts:
            # prints the name of the part
            print(part.name)
        
        # gets the first product and fetches its URL
        first_product_url = parts[0].url
        # gets the Product object for the item
        product = fetch_product(first_product_url)
        # prints the product's specs using the specs attribute
        print(product.specs)
        ```
        Here is another program that finds i3s that are cheaper than or equal to £110, prints their specs and then prints the first review:
        ```python
        from pypartpicker import part_search, fetch_product
        from time import sleep
        
        # returns a list of Part objects we can iterate through
        # the region is set to "uk" so that we get prices in GBP
        parts = part_search("i3", region="uk")
        
        # iterates through the parts
        for part in parts:
            # checks if the price is lower than 110
            if float(part.price.strip("£")) <= 110:
                print(f"I found a valid product: {part.name}")
                print(f"Here is the link: {part.url}")
                # gets the product object for the parts
                product = fetch_product(part.url)
                print(product.specs)
                # makes sure the product has reviews
                if product.reviews != None:
                    # gets the first review
                    review = product.reviews[0]
                    print(f"Posted by {review.author}: {review.content}")
                    print(f"They rated this product {review.rating}/5.")
                else:
                    print("There are no reviews on this product!")
                    
            # slows down the program so as not to spam PCPartPicker and potentially get IP banned
            sleep(3)
        ```
